class TfIdf(BaseModel):
    """
    Transforms a term-frequency model into a term-frequency
    inverse-document-frequency model.

    A TF-IDF model is term frequency model whose rows, corresponding
    to word types, are scaled by IDF values. The idea is that a word
    type which occurs in most of the contexts (i.e., documents) does
    less to distinguish the contexts semantically than does a word
    type which occurs in few of the contexts. The document frequency
    is the number of documents in which a word occurs divided by the
    number of documents. The IDF is the log of the inverse of the
    document frequency.

    As with a term-frequency model, word types correspond to matrix
    rows and contexts correspond to matrix columns.

    The data structure is a sparse float matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tf_matrix : scipy.sparse matrix
        A matrix containing the term-frequency data.
    context_type : string 
        A string specifying the type of context over which the model
        trainer is applied.

    Attributes
    ----------
    corpus : Corpus
        A Corpus object containing the training data
    context_type : string
        A string specifying the type of context over which the model
        trainer is applied.
    matrix : scipy.sparse.coo_matrix
        A sparse matrix in 'coordinate' format that contains the
        frequency counts.
    undefined_rows : list
        A list of row indices corresponding to words which have zero
        document frequency (so which have an undefined idf).

    Methods
    -------
    train
        Computes the IDF values for the input term-frequency matrix,
        scales the rows by these values and stores the results in
        `self.matrix`
    save
        Takes a filename or file object and saves `self.matrix` and
        `self.context_type` in an npz archive.
    load
        Takes a filename or file object and loads it as an npz archive
        into a BaseModel object.

    Notes
    -----
    A zero in the matrix might arise in two ways: (1) the word type
    occurs in every document, in which case the IDF value is 0; (2)
    the word type occurs in no document at all, in which case the IDF
    value is undefined.
